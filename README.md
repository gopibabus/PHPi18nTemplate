# ðŸ”¥i18n (Internationalization)

The terms are frequently abbreviated to the numeronyms **i18n** (where 18 stands for the number of letters between the first i and the last n in the word _internationalization_), a usage coined at Digital Equipment Corporation in the 1970s.

**L10n** for _localization_, due to the length of the words.

Some companies, like IBM and Oracle, use the term _globalization_, **g11n**, for the combination of _internationalization and localization_. Also known as "_glocalization_".
